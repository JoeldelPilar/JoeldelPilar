# Hello!

### - Let me introduce myself!

<p>My name is Joel del Pilar, Im 35 years old (as of 2022) <br>
I have a background in electronics and also a few years in the Swedish<br>
school-system.</p>

<p>Right now Im currently a student at ***"Medieinstitutet"*** in Stockholm<br>
and studing to become a FrontEnd Developer.</p>

<p>Out side of studing I spend alot of time with the family. Married to <br>
Stephanie and we have three amazing kids. Love to take pictures the old fashion <br>
way with film, it slowes things down and is just what I need in my live atm. </p>
