# Hello :wave:

## - about :rocket:

I started out as a frontend developer and in 2024 I began working with backend development using Fastify and Go. My goal in every project is to deliver clean and robust solutions. I use both my experience and AI in my daily work to solve tasks and improve codebases.


## experience
[![My Skills](https://skillicons.dev/icons?i=js,ts,html,css,sass,react,nextjs,vue,vite,express,nodejs,md,mongodb,jest,figma,git,github,vscode,go)](https://skillicons.dev)

I love to learn new skills so the list will continue to grow. Some skills and techniques are used in my daily work, others on and off.
